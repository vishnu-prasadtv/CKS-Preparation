- Physical Devices:
  - The USB ports or peripheral slots on the server that are not planned to be used must be disabled to prevent attacks.

- Access
  -  What user accounts are to be configured?
  -  Which users have access to the system?
  -  Users who log in as root user.
  -  The server should have sudo configured.

- Network
  - Firewall to allow only required ports.
  - IP tables to open only required ports.
